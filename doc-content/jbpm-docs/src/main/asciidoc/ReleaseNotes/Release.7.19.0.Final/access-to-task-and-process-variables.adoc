= Simplified access to Task and Process variables in Manage and Task Inbox sections

In this release, the Manage Process Instance, Manage Tasks and Task Inbox, have been enhanced to facilitate access to custom variables.
Previously, the only way to access these custom variables was to create an Advanced Filter using either the Task Name
or the Process Id. Now users can use the newly added pre-defined filters (based on Task Name and Process Id) to filter a
specific instance or task and also make use of the extra variables as columns in the resulting table.
