= Added color configurations for process instance diagrams

The following new properties were added in *Settings -> Process Administration* in {CENTRAL} to enable you to
change the node colors used in process instance diagrams:

* Completed node color
* Completed node border color
* Active node border color

When you modify these configurations, the change is applied to all process instance diagrams in {CENTRAL}.
