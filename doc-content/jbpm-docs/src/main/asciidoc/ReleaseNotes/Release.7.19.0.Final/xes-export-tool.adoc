= jBPM XES Export

This release includes a new tool that aims to facilitate exporting XES based logs from the jBPM runtime.
These logs can then be consumed by different process mining tools to analyse different aspects from the process runtime
execution such as conformance, performance, deviations, process discovery and more.
eXtensible Event Stream (XES) is an xml based standard that unifies the interchange event data information between
information systems on one side and analysis tools on the other side.
For more information regarding the XES standard, please visit: http://www.xes-standard.org/.
To get started using the export tool, please check instructions in: https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/tree/master/jbpm-xes.
